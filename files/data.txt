this book seeks to satisfy a genuine need on the part of technology practitioners in the internet space who are faced with having to make difficult decisions as to what research has been done and what the best practices are

there is also a strong emphasis on evaluation in every chapter both in terms of methodology how to evaluate and what controlled experimentation and industrial experience have to tell us
